            [Intro]
            Hope
            Yeah, I'm on my way, I'm comin'
            Don't
            Don't lose faith in me
            I know you've been waiting
            I know you've been prayin' for my soul
            Hope
            Hope
            Thirty years you been draggin' your feet, tellin' me I'm the reason we're stagnant
            Thirty years you've been claiming you're honest and promising progress, well, where's it at?
            I don't want you to feel like a failure
            I know this hurts
            But I gave you your chance to deliver
            Now it's my turn
            Don't get me wrong
            Nate, you've had a great run
            But it's time to
            Give the people somethin' different
            So without furthеr ado, I'd
            Like to introduce my
            My album (My album)
            My album (My album), my album
            My album (My album), my album (My album), my album (My album)
            My album—

            [Verse 1]
            What's my definition of succеss? (Of success)
            Listening to what your heart says (Your heart says)
            Standing up for what you know is (Is)
            Right, while everybody else is (Is)
            Tucking their tail between their legs (Okay)
            What's my definition of success? (Of success)
            Creating something no one else can (Else can)
            Being brave enough to dream big (Big)
            Grinding when you're told to just quit (Quit)
            Giving more when you got nothing left (Left)
            It's a person that'll take a chance on
            Something they were told could never happen
            It's a person that can see the bright side
            Through the dark times when there ain't one
            It's when someone who ain't never had nothin'
            Ain't afraid to walk away from
            More profit 'cause they'd rather do somethin'
            That they really love and take the pay cut
            It's a person that would never waver
            Or change who they are
            Just to try and gain some credibility
            So they could feel accepted by a stranger
            It's a person that can take the failures in their life and turn them into motivation
            It's believing in yourself when no one else does, it's amazin'
            What a little bit of faith can do if you don't even believe in you
            Why would you think or expect anybody else that's around you to?
            I done did things that I regret, I done said things I can't take back
            Was a lost soul at a crossroad who had no hope, but I changed that
            I spent years of my life holdin' on to things I never should've kept, full of hatred
            Years of my life carryin' a lot of baggage that I should've walked away from
            Years of my life wishin' I was someone different, lookin' for some validation
            Years of my life tryna fill the void, pretending I was in—
            They get it
            [Verse 2]
            Growing pain's a necessary evil
            Difficult to go through, yes, but beneficial
            Some would say having a mental breakdown is a negative thing
            Which on one hand, I agree with
            On the other hand, it was the push I needed
            To get help and start the healing process, see if
            I'd have never hit rock bottom, would I be the person that I am today? I don't believe so
            I'm a prime example of what happens when you choose to not accept defeat and face your demons
            Took me thirty years to realize that if you wanna get that opportunity to be the
            Greatest version of yourself, sometimes you got to be someone you're not to hear the voice of reason
            Having kids will make you really take a step back and look in the mirror, at least for me, that's what it did, I

            [Part II]

            [Outro]
            Wake up every day and pick my son up, hold him in my arms and let him know he's loved (Loved)
            Standing by the window, questioning if Dad is ever going to show up (Up)
            Isn't something he's gon' have to worry 'bout, don't get it twisted, that wasn't a shot
            Mama, I forgive you, I just don't want him to grow up thinkin' that he'll never be enough
            Thirty years of running, thirty years of searchin'
            Thirty years of hurting, thirty years of pain
            Thirty years of fearful, thirty years of anger
            Thirty years of empty, thirty years of shame
            Thirty years of broken, thirty years of anguish
            Thirty years of hopeless, thirty years of (Hey)
            Thirty years of never, thirty years of maybe
            Thirty years of later, thirty years of fake
            Thirty years of hollow, thirty years of sorrow
            Thirty years of darkness, thirty years of (Nate)
            Thirty years of baggage, thirty years of sadness
            Thirty years of stagnant, thirty years of chains
            Thirty years of anxious, thirty years of suffering
            Thirty years of torment, thirty years of (Wait)
            Thirty years of bitter, thirty years of lonely
            Thirty years of pushing everyone away ('Way)
            (You'll never evolve) I know I can change
            (We are not enough) We are not the same
            (You don't have the heart) You don't have the strength
            (You don't have the will) You don't have the faith
            (You'll never be loved, you'll never be safe)
            (Might as well give up) Not running away
            (You don't have the guts) You're the one afraid
            (I'm the one in charge) I'm taking the— (No)
            I'm taking the
